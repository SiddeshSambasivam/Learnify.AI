EE2002 â€“ ANALOG ELECTRONICS
AU: 4 | Prerequisite: EE2001 | Lecture (Online); Tutorial (24 hrs); Laboratory (9 hrs)
Learning Objective
This course serves as an introductory analog electronic course. The course offers a broad range of
fundamental electronic device and circuit topics. The specific materials pertain to analog electronics
including diodes, bipolar-junction transistors (BJT), Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect
Transistors (MOSFET), basic amplifier configurations, multistage amplifier and differential amplifiers,
current sources and current mirrors, frequency response and operational amplifiers. This basic course
in analog electronics provides for analysis and design of analog electronic circuits, both discrete and
integrated, required of an electronics engineer.
