Course Objectives
Understand what is a Microprocessor.
Know the internal workings of an ARM processor.
Ability to program an ARM processor in assembly and
C language.
Introduction to Microprocessor
Microprocessors are used in Computers and
Embedded Systems.
Embedded systems : microprocessors are transparent
to the users e.g. in an ATM.
Microprocessor based systems are widely used in
home appliances and industrial systems.
A Microprocessor is a programmable chip that can
perform logical, arithmetic and control operations.
Microcontrollers
Microcontrollers are Microprocessors integrated
together with some Memory and I/O peripherals
on a single chip, resulting in lower chip count.
Peripherals integrated includes parallel I/O port,
clock generation circuitry, serial I/O port, ROM and
RAM.
Hence it is easier to use a microcontroller for
simpler applications.
Microcontrollers can be very low cost (sub dollar)
and can be very useful.
Processor Integration
Early computers had many separate chips for the
different portions of a computer system

Microprocessors
First microprocessors placed control, registers,
Arithmetic logic unit in one integrated circuit (one chip).

CPU – Central Processing Unit
The stored program computer consists of three units: the CPU, 
memory, and I/O devices.

Microcontrollers
Microcontrollers integrate all of the components
(control, memory, I/O) of a computer system into
one integrated circuit.  Microcontrollers are
intended to be single chip solutions for systems
requiring low to moderate processing power.

Microcontrollers are often called “hidden computers.” In this 
picture there are 14 different
microcontrollers. (Reprinted courtesy of Intel Corporation and Microcomputer

Definitions (Recap)
Microprocessor – A CPU on a single chip containing registers, ALU,
instruction decoder, addressing logic, internal busses, and control
logic.  Typically it cannot be operated in a standalone manner.
Microcontroller – A complete computer system on a chip containing
a CPU, memory, IO/interface controllers, timers, and other
specialized circuitry.  Typically it can be operated in a standalone
manner.
Embedded System – A system or device that has a dedicated
computer as one of its subsystems.  Examples are cell phones,
MP3 players, household appliances, etc.  They may contain
microcontrollers or embedded general purpose processors.
Real-time System – A system or device that is required to respond to
external events within a specified time period.

A Bit of ARM History
Originally conceived to be a processor for the
now entrenched in embedded markets
First well-known product
Apple®’s Newton™ PDA (1993) based on
an ARM6 core
Significant breakthrough
Apple®’s iPod® (2001) based on an
ARM7 core
ARM Ltd
Founded in November 1990
Spun out of Acorn Computers
Designs the ARM range of RISC processor cores
Licenses ARM core designs to semiconductor partners
who fabricate and sell to their customers.
ARM does not fabricate silicon itself
Also develop technologies to assist with the design-in of
the ARM architecture
Software tools, boards, debug hardware, application
software, bus architectures, peripherals etc
ARM Processor Architecture
ARM stands for “Advanced RISC Machine”.
based on Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)
architecture
trading simpler hardware circuitry with software
complexity (& size)
but latest ARM processors utilize more than 100
instructions
RISC Philosophy
Original RISC design (e.g., MIPS)
aims for high performance through
reduced number of instruction classes
large general-purpose register set
load-store architecture
fixed length instructions
Pipelines
enables simpler hardware; hence, scalable to higher
operating frequencies
ARM processor
ARM Processor
targeted for embedded applications as a processor
embedded for system-on-chip devices
not a pure RISC architecture (e.g., supports both 16-bit
and 32-bit instruction sets)
Also emphasizes the following:
high code density
low power consumption
small die size
cost effectiveness
Biggest market for ARM-based processors
mobile phones and smart phones
ARM Powered Products
ARM Partners
The ARM processor is not sold as a processor chip but as a
hardware IP license.
Licensees add their own logic and customized
peripherals and then manufacture the silicon processor
chip.
typically sold as ASIC/SOC for embedded applications
Some of the present and past licensees (ARM calls
them Partners) include:
Texas Instruments, Philips, Analog Devices, Qualcomm
Intel (StrongARM®  and XScale®)

Byte means 8 bits
Halfword means 16 bits (two bytes)
Word means 32 bits (four bytes)
Most ARM’s implement two instruction sets
