ARM7TDMI
 Programmerâ€™s
 Model
 ARM7TDMI
    ARM7 was introduced in 1993
    The updated version ARM7TDMI became hugely popular
    T for THUMB: a 16 bit instruction set, which is more compact than the standard 32 bit instruction set (We will focus on the standard instructions for now)
    D for Debug: new debugging hardware is added into the processor
    M for Multiplier: a larger hardware multiplier is included
    I for In-Circuit-Emulation: allows  hardware emulation of the actual processor
2 ARM States
    ARM State : Standard 32-bit length instructions are used
    THUMB State : Compressed 16-bit length instructions are used Provides flexibility of putting more instructions into the same amount of memory or reduce the amount of memory needed for a given design

 Description
 Entered on reset and when a Software Interrupt (SWI) Instruction is executed
 Entered when a high priority (fast ) interrupt is raised Entered when a low priority (normal) interrupt is raised
 Used to handle memory access violations Used to handle undefined instructions Privileged mode using the same registers as User mode
 Mode under which most applications/OS tasks run Privileged

Registers
    A Register is the most fundamental storage area on the chip, can be used to stored any data you wish
    ARM7TDMI has 37 32-bit registers   30 general-purpose registers   6 status registers   A program counter (PC)    Not all registers are visible at any one time
Banking of registers
    For example, when the processor changes to FIQ mode, a large number of registers (r8-r14) are banked, or swap out
    Done to save the current state of the machine During an interrupt, it is necessary to stop what you are doing and begin work on a task
    Rather than backing the original content of the registers into  the external memory which takes time, the machine simply used a new set of registers instead Hence execution speed improves!!!
Reserved Registers
    R13 is also known as Stack Pointer (SP) It holds the address of the stack in memory and a unique stack pointer exists in each mode (except System mode which shares the User mode stack pointer)
    R14 is also known as Link Register (LR) It is used as subroutine return address link register It is unique except for system mode which shares the same register as User mode
    R15 is the Program Counter (PC) It holds the address of the instruction being FETCHED (not the one being executed)
Instruction Execution
 Multiple stages are involved in executing an instruction Example:
 1)Fetching the instruction code 2)Decoding the instruction code 3)Executing the instruction code Hence multiple processor clock cycles are needed to execute one single instruction

 Instruction Pipeline
    Pipeline allows concurrent execution of multiple different instructions    execution of different stages of multiple instructions at the same time
    During a normal operation    while one instruction is being executed    the next instruction is being decoded    and a third instruction is being fetched from memory    allows effective throughput to increase to one instruction per clock cycle EE3002

    FETCH: Instruction fetched from memory    DECODE : Decoding of registers used in instruction    EXECUTE :
   Register(s) read from Register Bank,   Shift and ALU operation   Write register(s) back to Register Bank EE3002 Microprocessors 12
 Current Program Status Register(CPSR)    CPSR shows the state of the machine
    It contains condition code flags, interrupt enable flags, the current mode and the current state
    Each privileged mode (except System mode) has Saved Program Status Register (SPSR) that is used to preserve the value of CPSR when an exception occurs
 Program Status Register    Most significant 4 bits are condition code flags    Least significant 8 bits are control bits EE3002 Microprocessors 14
 Control Bits
    I and F bits are interrupt disable bits which disable IRQ interrupts and FIQ interrupts respectively For example, when I = 1, no IRQ interrupts are entertained
    T is the status bits to indicate the state of the machine ( ARM or THUMB) T =1 implies the machine is currently executing THUMB code This bit is read only (not writable), you can only change between ARM and THUMB state via a special instruction
 Mode Bits
    Least significant 5 bits, M[4:0] are the mode bits

 The Vector Table
    The exception vector table consists of designated addresses in external memory that hold information necessary to handle an exception, an interrupt, or other atypical event such as a reset
    For example, when an interrupt (IRQ) comes along, the processor will change the PC to 0x18 and fetch the actual ARM Instruction, which is most likely a Branch (B) instruction
