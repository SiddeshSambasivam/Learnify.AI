Key Things To Note: The workshop was conducted by Prof. Teh Kah Chan on the fundamentals of MATLAB.
The response for the workshop from the students was very positive and we planned to organize two session but was unable to conduct the second session due to COVID.
From the feedback form results we realized that the students were actually interested in much advance workshops with MATLAB such as MATLAB for machine learning.
To organize a MATLAB Workshop series could be one potential thing that could be pursued by the next incoming committee. TEL Survey. Background: The key idea for the initiative was to collect feedback from students about the quality of TEL, OASIS assessment and other aspects of curriculum. We collected feedback from students enrolled in each course and prepared a report based on the responses for th e course coordinators. The department worked with the EEE undergraduate office to broadcast the survey to all the students through email blasts and QR codes in tutorial.Key Things To Note:
One major issue was that for some courses the number of feedbacks was not representative of the total population and hence it was hard to substantiate any suggestions given by the club to the course coordinators. Industrial Interviews. Background: The initiative was to connect the EEE student community with the EEE Alumni community to create environment for students to learn more about various industry and its work experience. Key Things To Note:
We worked with Ms. May to contact the alumni working in different career fields to share more about their experiences. The intended career field needs to be obtained from the students.eTracks Background: E-tracks is a project mainly intended to track the skills development of students throughout their 4 years in EEE through the participation in different workshops and other projects under EEE and SLDU administration. Key Things To Note: We have already completed the basic app with charts to visualize the skillsets acquired from various workshops and has been documented well with proper version control in GitHub. The app was not pushed out for usage as it required previous data of the workshop and details of upcoming workshops which was stopped in response to COVID measures.
